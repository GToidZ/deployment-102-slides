## Objective
Successfully create and run a local stack with HTTPS connections.

---

# HTTP vs HTTPS
The differences between the two:

* HTTP messages are ***plaintext***, which means unauthorized parties can easily access and read them over the internet.
* HTTPS transmits all data in ***encrypted form***. When users submit sensitive data, they can be confident that no third parties can intercept the data over the network.

## Hands-On Activity 3
Deploy on PaaS

---

# My bad
I can't find a PaaS that doesn't require credit card.

Except, we have [**Vercel**](https://vercel.com/home), which seems like a PaaS, however they only support Javascript language and frameworks.

What we are going to do is actually take a tour of Vercel, and see how they actually deploy our application!

ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ That's a wrap! You are now:
* âœ… Able to construct a tech stack from ground up!
* âœ… Able to develop with environment as almost identical as production!
* âœ… Able to deploy applications on to PaaS or cloud hosting!

Where to from here:
* **First off,** apply the knowledge to your project!
* Remote deployments using CI/CD
* Disaster recovery plans
* High Availability (Kubernetes)
* Declarative infrastructure building (Terraform)
